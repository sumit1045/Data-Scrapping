# Data-Scrapping
<br>

## Intro

My understanding of web scraping is patience and attention to details. Scraping is not rocket science (deep learning is). When I do scraping, I typically spend 50% of my time in analyzing the source (navigate through HTML parse tree or inspect element to find the post form) and the rest 50% in ETL. The most useful tools for me are `requests`, `bs4` and `re`. Some people may recommend `selenium` for non-static website. To be honest, I have never used `selenium` throughout my career, but dynamic websites like Facebook and Twitter are still within my grasp. You see? patience and attention to details matter.
